# Real-Time Event Ticketing System

The Ticket Pool Management System is a multi-threaded application developed in Java for real-time ticket distribution and purchasing. It allows vendors to dynamically add tickets and customers to purchase them while monitoring ticket availability in real-time. The system features configurable parameters for seamless adaptability and ensures thread-safe operations using core Java synchronization mechanisms.
So this consists of two main components.
1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) – A Java-based ticket booking system that runs in the terminal.
2. Backend API – A Spring Boot-powered backend that manages event data, and ticket transactions.

## Tech Stack
CLI: Java, Multi-threading, Producer-Consumer Pattern
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), MySQL, REST API

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the system, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher
- Node.js (if integrating with UI): Version 16 or higher 
- Maven (optional): For managing dependencies An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA
